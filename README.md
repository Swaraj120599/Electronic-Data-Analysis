From Above data  the conclusion I found that the store best selling product is smartphones and the least selling product is Headphones and tablets. For smartphones we can say that not more work on that for least selling product  we can do more offers on that product and most of the product selling during the period of Festivals .
For  Less Average Rating the sloution is that completed order customer we can call thr person and ask for suggesttion that person give below 4 rating .Also find out the why customer cancel the order what problem? And work on that.
